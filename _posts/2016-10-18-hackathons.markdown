While I was an undergraduate I enjoyed attending Hackathons. My friend Lili and I
got started working on our startup GiftGuru, a gift recommendation engine,
at HackBeanPot in 2014. You can read about our project GiftGuru that won the Intuit award
[here].

Since becoming a professional software engineer I have wanted to give back to the
Hackathon community and now mentor undergrads. This past year, me and my coworkers
Eden and Matthew decided to attend a couple of Hackathons and promote Vertica while
mentoring some very talented students. You can read more about our adventures on the
[Vertica blog here].
