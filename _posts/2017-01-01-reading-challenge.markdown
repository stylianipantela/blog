summary: 2016 Reading Challenge
---

In 2015 I wrote a [blog] about how I wanted to make reading books more of a habit. [Goodreads], an online network for tracking and rating books, has been a huge motivator and enabler in forming and maintaining my habit. In 2015 I read 12 books. In 2016 doubled my goal and read 24 books.

Here is the list. I have starred the books I would recommend to a friend enthusiastically. If you read any of the following books and want to discuss them with me, please send me an email. As a friend helped me conclude last week that is the most effective way of really exploring a book.

In 2017, I am planning to read 24 books again. If you have in mind any books related to existentialism,  existential psychotherapy, computer science history and practice (not purely technical please), feminism, fiction or just in general wonderful book recommendations send them my way.
