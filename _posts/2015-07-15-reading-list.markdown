summary: How doing some calculations changed my attitude towards reading books.
---


<!-- Realization. -->
I did some calculations last year that made me conclude I am not reading as many books as I would like to. The average life expectancy in Greece is 80 years and at a rate of 10 books per year, the average Greek would read about 800 books, assuming she starts reading at age 0. 800 is a tiny number considering how many incredible books are out there. Thanks to [Goodreads], a book tracking and rating website I realized that I barely read five non-college related books in 2014 when I falsely thought I was reading at least 10 books per year. Being surrounded by huge libraries and people carrying loads of books around all the time it becomes easy to "forget" to pick up one from the non required pile and read it for pleasure. Everytime I picked up a literature book I would think to myself I better be reading school related material to optimize for learning.

<!-- Throwback.  -->
Now is time for a quick throwback. I used to be a decent reader growing up. In Greece, childrens' and young adults' literature is extremely rich and I was very fortunate to have been introduced to it by my mother at an early age. I would average more than 20 books per year and would spend hours reading every single page in addition to the books assigned for school work. Upon entering high school and having switched to more "grown-up" authors like Dostoyevsky and Camus which I absolutely enjoyed I managed to keep up a decent pace of about 6-8 books per year.

<!-- Future.  -->
Coming to college though I left behind my thirst for literature and I regret it because I love reading, I enjoy the activity for its own shake. It allows me to unplug from technology, focus, and learn while partaking in one of the most amazing shared experiences of our society. For that I have taken up the 12 book per year reading challenge on Goodreads. I am so far averaging one book per month. Here is my reading list for 2015 that I will keep updating:

<ul>
  <li>The Master and Margarita, Mikhail Bulgakov</li>
  <li>Nothing to Envy, Barbar Demick</li>
  <li>Lean In: Women, Work and the Will to Lead, Sheryl Sandberg</li>
  <li>Excellence without a Soul: How a Great University Forgot Educatoin, Harry R. Lewis</li>
  <li>Νίκη, Χ.Α. Χωμενίδης</li>
  <li>Justice: What's the Right Thing to Do?, Michael J. Sandel</li>
  <li>Twice a Stranger: The Mass Expulsions that Forged Modern Greece and Turkey, Bruce Clark</li>
  <li>The unbearable lightness of being, Milan Kundera</li>
</ul>
