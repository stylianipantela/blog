I was on track with the 2015 challenge, so I thought I would keep it up for 2016 and also do 24 books this year. The catch is that I will not rule a book out based on length, which would let me stay in track but would also go against the purpose of this challenge. More details on that in the original blogpost. Here is my reading list for 2016 that I will keep updating:

<ul>
  <li>Elon Musk: Inventing the Future, Ashlee Vance</li>
  <li>The three body problem, Liu Cixin</li>
  <li>The Golden Compass, Philip Pullman</li>
  <li>Jonathan Livingston Seagull, Richard Bach </li>
  <li>The Case Against Perfection: Ethics in the Age of Genetic Engineering, Michael J. Sandel</li>
  <li>The Subtle Knife, Philip Pullman</li>
  <li>The Amber Spyglass, Philip Pullman</li>
  <li>The Only Woman in the Room: Why Science Is Still a Boys' Club, Eileen Pollack</li>
  <li>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, J.K. Rowling</li>
  <li>Expect To Win, Carla A. Harris</li>
  <li>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, Junot Diaz</li>
  <li>Me Before You, Jojo Moyes</li>
  <li>Vintage, Susan Gloss</li>
