summary: I just came back from a three week trip to Australia. I was there to attend the SIGMOD 2015 Conference which lasted for about a week and also for a quick tour around the country. For those of you not familiar with SIGMOD, it is one of the biggest conferences on Data Systems organized annually at various cities in the world. This year it took place in Melbourne. That allowed me to travel to the southern hemisphere for the first time. This post is an effort to capture my experiences in Aussie land for my friends and for the random blog reader.

I just came back from a three week trip to Australia. I was there to attend the SIGMOD 2015 Conference. For those of you not familiar with SIGMOD, it is one of the biggest conferences on Data Systems organized annually. This year it took place in Melbourne. That allowed me to travel to the southern hemisphere for the first time. This post is an effort to capture my experiences in Aussie land for my friends and for the random blog reader. I will talk mostly about travelling. For those of you interested in the conference, feel free to ask me.

Food. Among the delicacies we tried were gourmet kangaroo dishes, like kangaroo souvlaki and kangaroo with chocolate. You are supposed to have it medium rare, it tastes like beef for the most part, and is supposed to be leaner. Other than kangaroo, Australia has a thing for gelato ice cream and you can find these places called [N2] everywhere. According to wikipedia, Melbourne has the largest Greek population outside of Greece, so greek food is also a safe bet.

Animals. I was part of the undergrad track of the Conference and got to meet some awesome fellow college students doing research in the area of databases. One of them, Susan was way too excited for the potential of coming across quokkas in the Melbourne Zoo. So, off we went. We came across kangaroos and emus, Australia's national animals as well as elephants, red pandas and of course coalas hidden at the top of eucalyptus trees. We got to play with the kangaroos and the quokkas, which was in my top experiences. It turns out that the Melbourne zoo really cares about the well being of its animals and tests their happiness levels every six months. Outside the zoo, we saw more wild kangaroos at a golf course on the Ocean Road. In our trip to bla we stopped at the kangaroo orphanage. On my way to Uluru from Alice Springs I rode a camel. The local farmer walked me around for a bit and then started running. It was a very bumpy ride but also tons of fun. I was mostly trying not to fall down. I do not really like riding very much though. I prefer interacting wtih animals like petting and feeding them. It makes for a more intimate and genuine experience.

Melbourne Must sees. Melbourne is an incredible city for just walking around. While walking I crossed the Immigration Bridge which is truly spectacular. It has detailed information on the immigrants that came to Australia from every country in the world. Greece couldn't be missing of course. Also, worth checking out is St. Patrick's Cathedral. I was lucky to stop by at a morning Sunday service. Finally, one of the best walks in Melbourne is the so called Princess walk at the by the Yarra River all the way to the Cricket Ground. Being a tennis enthusiast the Cricket Ground was much less interesting than the Rod Laver Arena. It is the court where the Australian Open is held. I rushed inside to catch the 11.30am tour and it was so worth it. Probaly my favorite place in Melbourne. Too bad it is not January when the Open takes place. At the same time it was better because I got to experience the super awesome tour that is not allowed during the championship. It started at the men's locker room. Yes you guessed right, this is where Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal get ready for their games. I double checked their lockers for items left behind but no luck there. The tour guide told us that Federer goes to the cafe to be with family before games and Nadal listens to music. We saw the media room and sat at the chairs where the players give the press conferences after the games. Then we went to the Arena which was unfortunately turned into a basketball court and sat at one of the corporate boxes. Those go for about 300K a year. We also stambled upon the trophies just lying by the entrance for anyone to "grab".

Sydney must sees. Sydney has two main attractions: the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour bridge. Both are extremely commercialized and pretty awesome.

Yara Valley Tour.

Great Ocean Road.

Uluru.

Melbourne.
Topdeck Tour.
Sydney.
