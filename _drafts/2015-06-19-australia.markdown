summary: My adventures in the Southern Hemisphere.
---


I just came back from a three week trip to Australia. I was there to attend the [SIGMOD] 2015 Conference. For those of you not familiar with SIGMOD, it is one of the biggest conferences on Data Systems organized annually. This year it took place in Melbourne. That allowed me to travel to the southern hemisphere for the first time. This post is an effort to capture my experiences in Aussie land for my friends and for the random blog reader.

<!-- Melbourne Must sees.  -->
Melbourne is an incredible city for just walking around. While walking I crossed the Immigration Bridge which is truly spectacular. It has detailed information on the immigrants that came to Australia from every country in the world. Greece couldn't be missing of course. Also, worth checking out is St. Patrick's Cathedral. I was lucky to stop by at a morning Sunday service. Finally, one of the best walks in Melbourne is the so called Princess walk at the by the Yarra River all the way to the Cricket Ground. Being a tennis enthusiast the Cricket Ground was much less interesting than the Rod Laver Arena. It is the court where the Australian Open is held. I rushed inside to catch the 11.30am tour and it was so worth it. Probaly my favorite place in Melbourne. Too bad it is not January when the Open takes place. At the same time it was better because I got to experience the super awesome tour that is not allowed during the championship. It started at the men's locker room. Yes you guessed right, this is where Federer, Djokovic, and Nadal get ready for their games. I double checked their lockers for items left behind but no luck there. The tour guide told us that Federer goes to the cafe to be with family before games and Nadal listens to music. We saw the media room and sat at the chairs where the players give the press conferences after the games. Then we went to the Arena which was unfortunately turned into a basketball court and sat at one of the corporate boxes. Those go for about 300K a year. We also stambled upon the trophies just lying by the entrance for anyone to "grab".

<!-- Great Ocean Road. -->
An awesome road trip I did while in Melbourne was on the Greate Ocean Road. It is just a big trip on the awesome seasore, that has some spectacular sights including the 12 Apostles, which is very scenic, the London Bridge, which is falling down, a cool lighthouse and just in general a very calming ocean view.

<!-- Uluru -->
A big must see in Australia is the large sandstone formation called Uluru, in the southern part of the Northern Territory. It is sacred to the aboriginal people of the area. It is also an Unesco world heritage site. Climbing it is discouraged, disrepectful to the aboriginals and pretty dangerous but people do it anyway. One company owns the closeby resort, which is where we stayed. My memories include an amazing sunset and an unforgettable walking tour around the stone, which is around 10k and took us 3 hours.

<!-- Sydney must sees.  -->
Sydney has two main attractions: the Opera House and the Sydney Harbour bridge. Both are extremely commercialized and pretty awesome. The opera house is meant to be spectacular from all angles, so try a few. My favorite spots include the rooftop of the Contemporary Art Museum, Mrs Macquarie's Chair, and the Bridge. There is also an incredible tour of the building, which I highly recommend for an insider's view and a sneak peak at the opera rooms. Also, if you are there on a Friday night which I was, try out the Chinatown night market. Among other things there are stands of yum cha, teppanyaki, takoyaki, sushi, Sichuan and pho. I tried grilled squid and red bean pancakes. Then set off to walk by Darling Harbor. There are also a bunch of bars and a good deal of night life. Also, while wandering around I randomnly discovered the Sydney swans.

<!-- Future visit. -->
All in all, I head a great time while in Australia and would definitely try to go back. Among the things I want to do that did not have time to is check out the northern part, I hear it is great for snorkelling, visit the penguin island from Melbourne and spend more time in Sydney.
